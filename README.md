# Age-Gender-Detection
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an accurate and efficient system for automatic sex classification and age prediction from facial images. It aims to advance the state-of-the-art in facial analysis by offering practical solutions across several industries, including healthcare, biometrics, and marketing.

🔑 Key Features:
Sex Classification: The system accurately determines the gender of individuals based on their facial features.
Age Regression: It estimates the age of individuals using deep learning techniques, capturing subtle changes in facial appearance.
Robust Performance: The CNN-based model captures complex patterns and variations in facial data, making it robust against challenges like lighting, facial expressions, and occlusions.

🚀 Applications:
Healthcare: Accurate age estimation aids in patient profiling, diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans, especially in age-dependent conditions.
Biometrics and Security: Enhances the accuracy and reliability of facial recognition systems, ensuring more secure and efficient identity verification processes.
Marketing and Consumer Research: Facilitates targeted advertising and demographic analysis, enabling businesses to fine-tune strategies and improve customer engagement.

📊 Dataset:
The model is trained on a diverse and well-annotated dataset containing over 237,000 images, including details of age, gender, and ethnicity.
The dataset used in this project is [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv?rvi=1]

Dataset Features:
Number of images: 237,000+
Attributes: Age, Gender, Ethnicity
Preprocessing: Images have been preprocessed to align faces, normalize pixel values, and remove noise.

🛠️ Technologies and Tools:
Python: Core language for model development.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used to build and train the CNN model.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing, such as face alignment and resizing.
Pandas and NumPy: For efficient data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and performance metrics.

📈 Model Architecture and Training:
The CNN model consists of several convolutional layers to capture essential facial features, followed by fully connected layers for sex classification and age regression tasks. Key components include:
1. Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
2. Batch normalization to accelerate convergence.
3. Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
4. Loss Functions:
     1. For sex classification: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.
     2. For age regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  
🎯 Performance Metrics:
Sex Classification Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between male and female faces.
Age Estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The system maintains a low MAE in age prediction, making it suitable for real-world applications.

📝 Future Enhancements:
Ethnicity Prediction: Add an additional layer for ethnicity classification.
Model Optimization: Experiment with different architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) to improve performance.
Deployment: Create an easy-to-use web interface using Flask or FastAPI for real-time facial analysis.
